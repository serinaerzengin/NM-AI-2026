Astar Island — Viking Civilisation Prediction
What is this?
Astar Island is a machine learning challenge where you observe a black-box Norse civilisation simulator through a limited viewport and predict the final world state. The simulator runs a procedurally generated Norse world for 50 years — settlements grow, factions clash, trade routes form, alliances shift, forests reclaim ruins, and harsh winters reshape entire civilisations.
Your goal: observe, learn the world's hidden rules, and predict the probability distribution of terrain types across the entire map.

Task type: Observation + probabilistic prediction
Platform: app.ainm.no
API: REST endpoints at api.ainm.no/astar-island/


How It Works

A round starts — the admin creates a round with a fixed map, many hidden parameters, and 5 random seeds
Observe through a viewport — call POST /astar-island/simulate with viewport coordinates to observe one stochastic run through a window (max 15×15 cells). You have 50 queries total per round, shared across all 5 seeds.
Learn the hidden rules — analyze viewport observations to understand the forces that govern the world
Generate predictions — use your understanding to build probability distributions for the full map
Submit predictions — for each of the 5 seeds, submit a W×H×6 probability tensor predicting terrain type probabilities per cell
Scoring — your prediction is compared against the ground truth using entropy-weighted KL divergence

The Core Challenge
The simulation is stochastic — the same map and parameters produce different outcomes every run. With only 50 queries shared across 5 seeds, and each query only revealing a 15×15 viewport of the 40×40 map, you must be strategic about what you observe and how you use that information.


The world is governed by many hidden forces that interact in complex ways. Teams that understand these interactions can build accurate models and generate predictions far beyond what raw observation provides.

Key Concepts



Concept
Description




Map seed
Determines terrain layout (fixed per seed, visible to you)


Sim seed
Random seed for each simulation run (different every query)


Hidden parameters
Values controlling the world's behavior (same for all seeds in a round)


50 queries
Your budget per round, shared across all 5 seeds


Viewport
Each query reveals a max 15×15 window of the map


W×H×6 tensor
Your prediction — probability of each of 6 terrain classes per cell


50 years
Each simulation runs for 50 time steps
