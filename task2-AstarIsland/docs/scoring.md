Astar Island Scoring
Score Formula
Your score is based on entropy-weighted KL divergence between your prediction and the ground truth.
Ground Truth
For each seed, the organizers pre-compute ground truth by running the simulation hundreds of times with the true hidden parameters. This produces a probability distribution for each cell.
For example, a cell might have ground truth [0.0, 0.60, 0.25, 0.15, 0.0, 0.0] — meaning 60% chance of Settlement, 25% Port, 15% Ruin, after 50 years.

KL Divergence
For each cell, the KL divergence measures how different your prediction is from the ground truth:
KL(p || q) = Σ pᵢ × log(pᵢ / qᵢ)

Where p = ground truth, q = your prediction. Lower KL = better match.
Entropy Weighting
Not all cells are equally important. Static cells (ocean stays ocean, mountain stays mountain) have near-zero entropy and are excluded from scoring.
Only dynamic cells (those that change between simulation runs) contribute to your score, weighted by their entropy:
entropy(cell) = -Σ pᵢ × log(pᵢ)

Cells with higher entropy (more uncertain outcomes) count more toward your score. This focuses scoring on the interesting parts of the map.
Final Score
weighted_kl = Σ entropy(cell) × KL(ground_truth[cell], prediction[cell])
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                            Σ entropy(cell)

score = max(0, min(100, 100 × exp(-3 × weighted_kl)))


100 = perfect prediction (your distribution matches ground truth exactly)
0 = terrible prediction (high KL divergence)
The exponential decay means small improvements in prediction accuracy yield diminishing score gains

Common Pitfalls
Never assign probability 0.0 to any class. KL divergence includes the term pᵢ × log(pᵢ / qᵢ). If the ground truth has pᵢ > 0 but your prediction has qᵢ = 0, the divergence goes to infinity — destroying your entire score for that cell.
Even if you're confident a cell is Forest, the ground truth may assign a small probability to Settlement or Ruin across hundreds of simulations. A single zero in your prediction can tank your score.
Recommendation: Always enforce a minimum probability floor of 0.01 per class, then renormalize so the values still sum to 1.0:
prediction = np.maximum(prediction, 0.01)
prediction = prediction / prediction.sum(axis=-1, keepdims=True)
This small safety margin costs almost nothing in score but protects against catastrophic KL blowups.
Per-Round Score
Each round has 5 seeds. Your round score is the average of your per-seed scores:
round_score = (score_seed_0 + score_seed_1 + ... + score_seed_4) / 5

If you don't submit a prediction for a seed, that seed scores 0. Always submit something for every seed — even a uniform prediction beats 0.
Leaderboard
Your leaderboard score is your best round score of all time:
leaderboard_score = max(round_score × round_weight) across all rounds

Round weights increase over time (1.05^round_number), so a good score on a later round counts for more. Only your single best weighted result matters — keep improving your model across rounds. Stashed changes
A hot streak score (average of your last 3 rounds) is also tracked.
Game End
Each round has a prediction window (typically 2 hours 45 minutes). After the window closes:
